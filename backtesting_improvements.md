# TuringTrader Backtesting Improvements

This update addresses the issues with data sources for backtesting in the TuringTrader algorithm, enabling the use of real historical data from Yahoo Finance for more accurate performance evaluation.

## Key Changes

1. **Data Source Management**:
   - Modified the backtesting engine to explicitly use `HistoricalDataFetcher` for real market data
   - Added automatic fallback to a new `RealisticMockDataFetcher` when Yahoo Finance can't be accessed
   - Added clear indication in output about which data source is being used

2. **Enhanced Data Control**:
   - Added a new `--refresh-data` command-line option to force refresh of historical data (ignore cache)
   - Improved caching mechanism to ensure data can be reused between runs

3. **Realistic Market Data Simulation**:
   - Created `RealisticMockDataFetcher` that generates realistic market data when real data is unavailable
   - Implemented realistic price movements, volatility patterns, and option pricing

4. **Improved Output and Reporting**:
   - Added detailed performance summary table across risk levels
   - Enhanced investment growth and risk comparison charts
   - Clear indication of data source being used for transparency

## Usage

Run backtesting with real Yahoo Finance data (preferred):

```
python evaluate_algorithm.py --config config.ini
```

Force refresh of data to ensure most recent information:

```
python evaluate_algorithm.py --config config.ini --refresh-data
```

For testing only (uses simplified mock data):

```
python evaluate_algorithm.py --config config.ini --test-mode
```

## Results & Performance

The backtesting results show that the current algorithm strategy may need significant optimization:

1. **Data Source**: When run with realistic data (either from Yahoo Finance or the realistic mock data generator), the algorithm shows severe drawdowns across all risk levels.

2. **Risk Analysis**: The analysis indicates that:
   - All risk levels show negative returns (-99% range)
   - Sharpe ratios are consistently negative, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns
   - The win rate (percentage of profitable trades) is low

3. **Strategy Evaluation**:
   - The strategy appears to be depleting capital rapidly through options trading
   - Position sizing may be too aggressive
   - The volatility-based entry/exit signals may need recalibration

## Next Steps

1. Revisit the options strategy implementation:
   - Reduce position sizing (currently too aggressive)
   - Implement better risk management to prevent excessive drawdowns

2. Improve entry/exit logic:
   - Recalibrate volatility thresholds
   - Add more conservative profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms

3. Consider alternative strategies like:
   - Vertical spreads to reduce capital requirements
   - Iron condors for income generation in more stable markets
   - Portfolio diversification across multiple underlyings
