# TuringTrader Algorithm Optimization

This update addresses the issues with the previous algorithm implementation by introducing more conservative risk management parameters and improved backtesting capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### Risk Management Enhancements

1. **Position Sizing Reductions**:
   - Reduced base position size by 35-45% across all scenarios
   - Added a 0.8 safety factor to all position size calculations
   - Lowered the maximum account percentage cap from 15% to 10% for standard instruments
   - Reduced the maximum account percentage cap from 10% to 7% for options

2. **Options Strategy Improvements**:
   - Reduced position size multipliers for all volatility signals
   - Added minimum return-on-risk check (15%) to avoid low-reward trades
   - Added minimum credit check ($0.20 per spread) to ensure adequate premium
   - Added additional cap on quantity based on account size (0.5% of account per spread)
   - Enhanced stop-loss and profit-taking mechanisms

3. **Volatility-Based Adjustments**:
   - Implemented more conservative scaling for different volatility levels
   - Reduced position sizing more aggressively in high volatility environments
   - Added volatility regime-based safety factors

### Backtesting Capabilities

1. **Enhanced Data Generation**:
   - Improved realistic mock data generation for better algorithm testing
   - Created realistic volatility patterns to test algorithm under various market conditions
   - Added IV/HV ratio support to properly simulate volatility harvesting opportunities
   - Implemented realistic option chain generation with proper skew and pricing

2. **Advanced Backtesting**:
   - Created new `run_enhanced_backtest.py` script for comprehensive testing
   - Added support for evaluating all risk levels (1-10)
   - Generates detailed performance metrics and comparison reports
   - Identifies optimal risk settings based on risk-adjusted returns

## Running the Backtests

To evaluate the algorithm with the improved parameters and realistic data:

```bash
python run_enhanced_backtest.py
```

This will run the backtest across all risk levels and generate results in the `optimized_backtest_results` directory.

## Expected Outcomes

The optimizations are designed to achieve:

1. **Neutral to Positive Returns**: More conservative position sizing and selective entry criteria aim to maintain at minimum flat returns even in challenging market conditions.

2. **Reduced Drawdowns**: The enhanced risk management parameters should reduce the severity of drawdowns.

3. **Better Volatility Adaptation**: The algorithm should now perform more consistently across varying market volatility regimes.

4. **Improved Risk-Adjusted Returns**: The changes should lead to better Sharpe ratios across risk levels.

## Configuration

The optimized parameters have been incorporated into the default configuration. Additional adjustments can be made in the `config.ini` file.
